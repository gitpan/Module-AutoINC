Module-AutoINC version 0.01
===========================

This module downloads and installs publicly available modules the first time 
they are used in a script if they are not already installed.  

When Module::AutoINC is loaded, it will add itself to @INC and catch any 
requests for missing resources.  If a Perl module is requested that has not been 
installed, then this will attempt to load it.  Under Active State Perl (or any 
Perl where PPM is available), PPM will attempt to install it.  Otherwise CPAN 
will be queried and, assuming that the module exists on CPAN, CPAN::Shell will 
be invoked to install it. Execution of the script continues after the requisite 
module has been installed.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

On windows systems you may need to use a different make program, such as nmake.

DEPENDENCIES

The only dependencies are to the standard modules CPAN, File::Basename, 
File::Spec, and Config.
